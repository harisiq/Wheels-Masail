The rebuild process should mirror that of a standard engine, with particular attention to setting gaps correctly to eliminate the need for a break-in period. Additionally, understanding the generator's specific RPM range, governed by controllers, is essential. While removing these controllers may allow RPM control akin to an engine, adherence to the manual's instructions renders this unnecessary. Marking components during disassembly facilitates straightforward reinstallation. Regarding fuel, a preference for petrol over CNG is recommended, given CNG's propensity for running hotter and drier. Regular oil changes, slightly before scheduled intervals, aid in draining any metal dust accumulation, with periodic switches between CNG and petrol advised to mitigate adverse effects on valves and valve seats. Lastly, consider adjusting tappets during the second oil change, typically occurring between 80-90 hours of operation.""]""}]}",,

This wire size indicates a larger diameter wire capable of carrying higher electrical currents. The length of the wiring can be customized based on specific requirements, typically depending on the distance between the power source and the device to be connected. When choosing the type of wire, options include OFC (Oxygen-Free Copper) and CCA (Copper-Clad Aluminum). OFC is preferable due to its superior conductivity and durability compared to CCA, which may be more affordable but less effective over long distances.

It is generally best to keep the number of passengers to a minimum. -  - 3) Kilometer Limit: There is usually a recommended minimum distance (kilometers) that should be covered during the break-in period of an overhauled engine. This distance allows the new components, such as rings, valve seals, and gaskets, to properly settle and function optimally. It is essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines and ensure that the recommended distance is covered before subjecting the engine to more demanding conditions. -  - It is important to note that these precautionary measures may vary depending on the specific car model and manufacturer. Therefore, it is always recommended to refer to the car's manual or consult with a professional mechanic for accurate and detailed guidance during the running period of an overhauled engine.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""The mechanic's installation of oversized rings on polished cylinders and the addition of ""helper rings"" could lead to premature engine failure, as the rings require a rough bearing surface to properly mate with the cylinder walls, typically achieved through cylinder honing. During a correct engine rebuild or re-ring process, the engine should be started and allowed to fully warm up while checking for leaks and testing oil pressure. The mechanic should then gradually load the engine through various driving steps to seat the rings properly against the bore, ensuring they lose their rough edge. However, oil helper rings may sometimes cause issues, such as flooding the second compression ring with oil, resulting in cylinder wall polishing. Despite these initial steps, the engine should be driven normally. Running at 4000 rpm is not excessively high, but if the engine is running unusually cool without a thermostat or with the fan direct and lacks coolant, or if the tappets are left loose, it could indicate other issues. To address abnormal engine behavior, it's essential to drive normally, ensure the engine is perfectly tuned, and maintain proper operating temperatures. Following these steps, including running the engine only when fully warmed up and using the correct engine oil as specified in the owner's manual, are crucial for prolonging engine life.""]""}]}",,

I'm here to assist you!""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Rust proof your car for free The cause of automotive rust Most perforation rust (perforation means the rust has eaten right through the metal) starts from the inside of an automotive panel, not the outside. What you see on the surface is usually just the tip of an iceberg. Any observant motorist travelling overseas in a warm, dry climate soon notices the absence of perforation rust in the local vehicles. Obviously moisture is the major cause of rust. Moisture from dew, rain, or condensation becomes trapped for long periods in dirt crevices, especially along the bottoms of doors and around the inner edges of guards. Even without dirt, lack of factory paint can result in perforation rust, especially in car roofs due to condensation. Parking your car outdoors every night without shelter in rain and dewey nights can speed up this process three fold. So how how can you stop existing rust and prevent new rust long term? Preventing rust How often you have seen a rusty steel gearbox, or a steering knuckle? Or when was the last time you heard of a car engine sump rusting through? Most likely never. But these parts are all subject to moisture, salt etc, and are bare unpainted steel. Why don’t they rust? The answer is oil and grease. These parts tend to pick up a thin layer of oil or grease. Oil and grease repel moisture. Rust is not a living thing like cancer, it requires moisture to continue. Deprive it of moisture and it stops forming, or never begins in the first place. This is the basis of the free rust-proofing secret. Smear some oil or grease on a piece of metal and try washing it off with water. Virtually impossible without detergent. Whether the oil or grease is dirty or clean it still has this same property of repelling water and sticking to metal. So all you need do to ensure that existing rust does not continue, or ever take hold in the first place, is to treat the inside crevices of automotive panels with oil or grease. Oil is easier to work with and has the added advantage of continuing to creep deep into crevices and cracks for months afterward. Don't waste money buying new oil. The oil drained from the engine or transmission of your car will work fine. Most garages will fill a can for you if you don’t like to change your own oil. How to do it Using oil for rust proofing must of course be left until after any intended rust repair and painting is completed, or the adhesion of filler and paint will be seriously affected. (If you want to stop rust in the meantime, etch paint primer both sides will generally do the job, and also provide an ideal key for filler on the outside.) A paintbrush is usually all that is required to apply oil to the insides of doors and other easily accessible panels. But some areas will require a bit of ingenuity. A spray-gun can be useful. However most oils will need to be thinned 10-15% with kerosene in order to spray. You can buy an accessory for the Wagner airless electric spray gun that consists of a long thin plastic 6mm (¼ inch) tube with a tiny spray nozzle in the tip. These are ideal for rust proofing hard to get at places like inside sills (the two bottom panels that run along below the doors) and roof edges. Just drilling a hole in a concealed area to gain access is all that is required Whichever method you use, don't worry about overdoing it. Saturation is the key word. Surplus oil will find its way out, just be careful where you park the vehicle for a few hours. Oil may continue to seep out of cracks and drainholes for days afterwards but normally does not drip and can easily be wiped off with a rag. Sills can be difficult to treat. Sometimes kickplates or carpet can be removed and holes drilled, or cut with a chisel, and a spray gun used (see above). If this fails, a professional rust-proofer can treat them for you. In easily accessible areas such as boot floors, or where a dry finish is desirable, etch priming and painting both sides of a panel can be the best solution. Exterior crevices Deep exterior crevices which are sometines found around windscreens etc, trap salts that can cause surface rust. This is especially noticeable in vehicles exposed to sea winds, or in areas subject to heavy air pollution. A simple way to prevent this type of rust is to fill these crevices with grease. The firm water resistant type designed for marine use is best. For a cleaner finish you can use a clear or black silicon. (Use masking tape along either side of the crevice when applying for a neat finsh.) If rust has already started, a combination of both can be used. Make sure the crevice is dry, then forcing in oil or grease deeply to saturate the rust and deprive it of moisture. Then thoroughly clean and dry the surface area and apply a thin layer of silicon to seal it in. Again use masking tape to keep a clean edge. Welding in new steel versus filling? Most motorists believe that the only effective way to rid their vehicles of rust is to weld in new steel panels. This is effective if the new metal is butt welded, ie, welded edge to edge to existing panels without any overlapping. However this is seldom done as it is too time consuming and costly. What usually happens is that the new panels being welded in are overlapped with the old and then the edge of the new panel welded on the outsid only. This however sets up ideal conditions within the overlap for continued rusting, and also makes it difficult if not impossible to rust proof effectively. The chemical reactions of welding can also chase rust along even faster. Often within two years the rust is showing through again. Whereas filling the rusted areas with a good quality water-resistant filler, applied over an etch primer or sound paint, not bare metal and rustproofing afterward can result in a permanant repair. However for areas that are too big to fill, or require the strength of steel, welding panels is the only option. If a long lasting repair is required, only butt welding should be used. Rustproofing should be rechecked and if necessary retreated every two years.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""Rust continues to be a persistent issue for cars, and while rust proofing is commonly suggested as a solution, alternative approaches exist, such as purchasing an all-aluminum defender. For those seeking rust converter products, options like Sloan rust converter from KK traders or Rustoleum rust converter available on Daraz are available, though it's essential to follow instructions carefully and avoid use on certain surfaces like marble. Some users have reported mixed experiences with these products, highlighting the importance of proper application. Additionally, advice varies on rust proofing methods, with suggestions to either heed recommendations from experts like @storm or undertake the task independently for more thorough coverage, as dealer applications may lack precision in reaching critical areas where rust often forms, particularly in regions where water collects and stagnates.""]""}]}",,

Due to the previous owners carelessness most of the clear coat on the car has faded in different places and the footboards have also begun to rust. I am getting it painted and have come to an agreement with a painter nearby in Johar (Karachi) for 45k for the complete denting and repainting of the car. Now I have no clue how the painters and denters here skimp out on work so I am looking for any pointers I should be looking for when they are doing the body work and paint job, any precautions and tips would be appreciated. I will post pictures of the car by tonight. I have done professional detailing, and still do it for friends and family when needed so I do have a good idea of what a good paint job looks like and I am familiar with the process of painting a car i.e body work, filling, sanding, primer, sanding, base coat, clear coat, wet sanding, compounding, polishing, no wax for a couple of weeks. The color of the car is pearl beige, almost the color of sand. The paint I have agreed upon is Nexa for base and clear. I will be going with the painter to fetch the paint.

This is why you need to find a good supplier. Secondly the air compressor you are using should be large enough to not short cycle constantly and you should have a very good moisture separator so you are not shooting water with the paint. The paint gun should be learned so the amount of spray can be dialed to the person handling the gun. A cheap gun results in bad finish. Use correct techniques to prep the paint including pepper coating to see the high and low sanding areas. Spraying it is also an issue as its easy to shoot dry spray which will result in a dead finish. Buy some mixing cups with measurements and ratios printed on the side of it and follow the manufacturer specs of the clear coat and its catalyser to get the correct ratio - do not try to ""andaaza"" it - it never works. (been there done that) - 3 wet coats of standox 2K clear will give you a very good finish provided you have sprayed the base correctly and evenly with a 30% overlap. Tape/disconnect/remove anything you can to get a clean/crisp finish everywhere. lastly - be safe, painting a car is hazardous to your health and can kill you so buy a respirator. Do not try to be He-man and commando the job with andaaza and no calculations or no safety. If you or your painter dont care then you might as well burn your money in a pile.""]""}]}",,

Symptoms of improper tappet or valve settings may include repetitive 'tik tik tik tik' sounds emanating from the engine.

When refueling, it's recommended to close the cap tightly and then loosen it back half a notch, allowing for proper ventilation and preventing vaporization issues that may affect the fuel level gauge. Additionally, if your car is equipped with CNG and an emulator, it's common for the petrol gauge to exhibit irregularities, as these systems can influence gauge readings independently. Moreover, the placement of the fuel sensor behind the fuel tank can contribute to fluctuations in gauge readings based on vehicle movement. For instance, when ascending or accelerating, fuel may shift towards the rear of the tank, leading to higher gauge readings, while descending or stopping can cause the opposite effect. Similarly, parking on slopes can affect gauge readings, with uphill parking potentially showing higher fuel levels and downhill parking showing lower levels. Overall, it's essential to be aware of these factors and consider cross-checking fuel levels using the odometer readings for a more accurate assessment of fuel consumption and remaining fuel.

So I took my Honda City 2015 to Honda Margalla. The car was initially tripping the AC after speed was 100kph, and this only happened once the car was in motion for 1-1.5 hour. The AC will then come back on with a hissing sound if I reduced the car to 70 80 kph and will not go off till I crossed 100 105 once more. This went on 2-3 trips on motorway. Then on one such ride the car started flashing overheating at 120+ initially which would go away if speed reduced. I checked, radiator coolant was 100% and both fans were working. Also, the AC tripping issue persisted. With this issue, I took it to HM. There was no error on the computer attached. They said they will first flush the radiator for overheat issue. They did and said the diagnostic showed no errors, and said should not heat up. (I believe this was not needed now, but at that time I consented). Then they told me (showed me) that the car only had 115 gm of gas, and topped it up. AC was fine (barring the trip thing imo) earlier but now after refilling gas it is super chill. Like ice cold chill. Here is a copy of my bill 18.5K basically. What do you think?

AC gas charging at 22rs per gram is justified, as Honeywell USA charges the same at our workshop. Mentioning PakWheels could get you further discounts. However, radiator wash isn't justified; AC compressor has a heat sensor, and only refrigerant top-up would have fixed the issue. The dealership tends to replace everything without identifying the root cause. Is there any pop-up notification appearing on the cell phone? Did they refill it with Honda coolant? I don't see the bill for the coolant. AC gas charging amount is okay, but flushing the radiator might have increased the cost. Be thankful the car's issue has been fixed; it could have been more expensive elsewhere.""]""}]}",,

There are two variants: Part No. 90915-10003 Made in Japan (costs 800 Rupees from genuine part dealers/about 1200 from Toyota 3S) This is the same part no. as Toyota catalog for Axio Part No. 90915-YZZE1 Made in Thailand (costs about 400 Rupees from genuine part dealers)  I have mostly seen Thailand made oil filters in oil change shops. They give option of Leppon filter but I was not given an option of Japanese Toyota oil filter. The main difference between the two seems to be the element inside, pressure plate and relief valve. Thai made is cheaper, probably because it is sort of a paper? and I suspect it will be prone to holes. I intend to dissect the oil filter once I go for next oil change to see what has happened to it. I am really interested in knowing the exact technical difference between the two. Whether it is safe to use the cheap Thai made oil filter, still a Toyota product for 5000 km interval. Other things like micron rating, by-pass valve setting, flow rate etc. of the two. So far I have only found one website, in Russian which has compared oil filters of different brands. The pictures attached here are all taken from the same website: Link-1212 Link-281 From Google's translation of the site, I understand that the Thai filter's pressure plate also serves as the relief valve i.e. no dedicated relief valve. (This obviously is another cost saving step) While on Japanese, the pressure plate is separate and relief valve is embedded within the filter element. Can someone please tell me the pros/cons of pressure plate serving as a relief valve as well? Here's what I am talking about, Japanese (pressure plate is to the right of filter, relief valve is embedded on top of the filter element):  Thai (nothing in the filter element, the pressure plate is also relief valve):  and some more detailed images  MADE IN JAPAN    Close up of the filter element. Relief valve can be clearly seen there, the coil thing.  MADE IN THAILAND  Nothing embedded in filter media. Pressure plate to the right also serves as relief valve   Close up of the filter element  Thank you for reading the topic. Looking forward to gain knowledge about this from everyone who can participate.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""For engines prone to sludge buildup like the 1MZFE, a fibrous-looking filter (Japanese) with a higher bypass pressure is recommended. This filter traps more particulates but fills up quickly, potentially flushing particulates into the engine if the bypass opens. It's advisable to use a low-viscosity, high-detergent oil with this filter. Another paper-type filter (ZZ part number) is suitable for general-purpose use and also has a bypass. Additionally, some new Toyota engines come with a fine media filter not readily available as a spare part, but the Japanese filter is a close match. Conducting a quality test involves cutting open a Leppon filter. Thinner oils help prevent oil pressure spikes, especially in conjunction with fine media filters. While fine media filters clean more efficiently, they may clog faster in dirty engines, leading to earlier bypass valve activation. Reusing the bypass valve of a fine media filter is challenging due to cartridge destruction during removal. However, genuine Toyota filters, regardless of origin, maintain quality standards. As for Suzuki oil filters, a comparative analysis would be beneficial. For Pakistani Corolla/Altis, filters supplied by Toyota are recommended, regardless of manufacturing location.""]""}]}",,

For Suzuki Bolan, consider using a different thermostat valve. Corrosion in the cluster gauge could be causing errors, a common issue in 1988-1993 Swift models. Regardless of the radiator's channel count or coolant capacity, the engine's thermostat will regulate temperature consistently.

To optimize the performance of your 2zzge engine, it's crucial to invest in engine management solutions like a piggyback or standalone ECU for precise tuning. Additionally, installing a wideband oxygen sensor facilitates accurate air-fuel ratio monitoring. Tuning fuel and ignition maps, adjusting VVTli timing, and considering upgrades such as porting the head and intake manifolds can enhance airflow and power delivery. Upgrading valve springs and the oil pump ensures proper valve control and lubrication under high revving conditions. Evaluating camshaft limitations, adjusting the final drive ratio, and upgrading to colder spark plugs if necessary further improve engine response and reliability. Additional considerations include aftermarket harmonic dampers to reduce rotational mass, internal upgrades like piston rings, and sourcing reputable aftermarket components for the fuel system, throttle body, and intake manifold. Gradual step-by-step upgrades allow for better understanding and optimization of engine behavior and performance while prioritizing safety and reliability.""]""}]}",,

If you've experienced coolant wastage, consider factors like the condition of the auto thermostat valve and the type of coolant used, such as zinc coolant or water. Searching for information on coolant can be facilitated through specific Google search strings. For checking coolant levels and detecting leakages, remember never to open the radiator cap when the engine is hot and inspect hose pipes for any abnormalities, especially in vehicles like Liana 07, where issues like sizzling sounds and water leaks may arise. Implement preventive measures such as regularly checking hose pipes and water heater connections for leaks, ensuring the radiator cap functions correctly, and avoiding running the vehicle without a thermostat valve or using plain water as coolant. Instead, opt for a coolant mixture prepared with bottled water. Additionally, conducting a compression test can help assess any potential damage caused by overheating. Lastly, for specific problems like a steel pipe connected to the thermostat showing signs of rust and minor holes, consider replacement and follow up with flushing the system and using coolant to prevent future issues.""]""}]}",,

Work was slow as i was a student back when i started, barely got anything to spend on it. And i wasn't sure about many things. Anyway learned through the process and right now the car starts. I haven't drove it yet because there are some issues that needs to be resolved. For example the rack is touching the transmission. Was talking with sir Xulfiqar about it so hopefully will get it sorted out. So the car is running on open source ecu. That was the main reason of this swap. As i have some more with me if anyone interested. Although i will be starting another k24 on same ecu soon. That car will come on road even before mine. I will share the details later. Coming to this project. It's a ae80 corolla chassis. My father own it from 1989. It was used to be daily runner but after when we got a secondary daily it got parked without shade for few years. That cause the chassis to get rusted pretty badly. I got my hands on it in 2016.

Will try to bring it to present date quickly as i'm going to drop some tuning related videos on youtube and elaborate it here as well.

This car is not meant to be daily driven and wouldn't be reliable. That's what you should keep in mind before going for such swaps.

Everything is changed except for head and crank. The engineering workshop guy gave its ceased turbo to someone for rebuilding. I trusted him and the result was pathetic. This rebuilt turbo FAILED within 2 hours of idling following first cold start after engine rebuild. Rest is fine, cold and warm starting are good, no heavy smoke at low to moderate RPM and it isn’t consuming engine oil anymore except for leaking turbo. Now someone has suggested me a workshop on Gawalmandi Road (Rawalpindi) near Kiani Autos who claims to be the specialist of turbo works. ** He told me that finding a new turbo of this engine is next to impossible, so he’d take the **kit from Suzuki Every Turbo variant and use it to rebuild Charade CL-60 Turbo with some alteration. He claims that this turbo would be as good as a new factory specs and would be long lasting. But the problem is, he is ONLY offering warranty of 2 days, if it fails within this period, it’s on him to redo the job but after that he won’t be responsible for any malfunction. 2nd option I have is to REMOVE this turbo which is going to eliminate the risk of failing turbo again. Since I use this car for shorter trips within city at much lower speed, deleting turbo may not adversely affect engine power and fuel economy. But you know this engine was designed to work with turbo so it may also shorten the engine life. So what would you suggest? Should this be REMOVED or REBUILT using Suzuki Every’s Turbo again?

Both options are available in a used condition. Since you are from Karachi, it would be convenient for you to purchase these components.  -  - For your Nissan Cedric Station wagon, I suggest the following setup: -  - Head Unit: Kenwood KDC BT600u - Amplifier: Kenwood KAC HQR8400 - Rear stage: JVC 6x9 five-way coaxial speakers -  - For the front stage, the Carrozzeria TS-C1710a components would be a suitable choice. However, if you are looking for a subwoofer, I recommend the Pioneer TS W307 D4. It will complement the overall sound system. -  - If you have any other suggestions within your budget, that would also be valuable. You mentioned that you wish to have a beginner SQ (sound quality) setup, considering your limited budget.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""For a quality sound setup, it's crucial to invest wisely and choose components that match your preferences and goals. While Kenwood components offer a warm tone, they may not be ideal for a SQ (sound quality) setup. Consider upgrading to Infinity Reference or JBL GTO components for improved performance. In terms of subwoofers, the JBL CS1214 or Infinity Reference 12 are better options compared to the outdated 307, especially when paired with a properly sized sealed enclosure filled with polyfill. Rear speakers are optional in SQ setups, with the focus typically on the front stage. If you still want rear fill, connect them directly to your head unit. Utilize your 4-channel amplifier for the front stage and sub, ensuring optimal power distribution. Consider returning the dB Drive components if they're too bright for your preferences. Running the rear fill from the pre direct allows the full potential of the amp to be utilized for the front stage and sub. If you plan to expand to multiple amp setups, a mono amp for the sub is recommended. Additionally, prioritize proper installation and consider sound deadening to minimize metal resonance in the cabin.

I'm here to assist you!""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Installing spark plugs Torque is one of the most critical aspects of spark plug installation. Torque directly affects the spark plugs' ability to transfer heat out of the combustion chamber. A spark plug that is under-torqued will not be fully seated on the cylinder head, hence heat transfer will be slowed. This will tend to elevate combustion chamber temperatures to unsafe levels, and pre-ignition and detonation will usually follow. Serious engine damage is not far behind. An over-torqued spark plug can suffer from severe stress to the Metal Shell which in turn can distort the spark plug's inner gas seals or even cause a hairline fracture to the spark plug's insulator...in either case, heat transfer can again be slowed and the above mentioned conditions can occur. The spark plug holes must always be cleaned prior to installation, otherwise you may be torquing against dirt or debris and the spark plug may actually end up under-torqued, even though your torque wrench says otherwise. Of course, you should only install spark plugs in a cool engine, because metal expands when its hot and installation may prove difficult. Gapping Since the gap size has a direct affect on the spark plug's tip temperature and on the voltage necessary to ionize (light) the air/fuel mixture, careful attention is required. While it is a popular misconception that plugs are pre-gapped from the factory, the fact remains that the gap must be adjusted for the vehicle that the spark plug is intended for. Those with modified engines must remember that a modified engine with higher compression or forced induction will typically require a smaller gap settings (to ensure ignitability in these denser air/fuel mixtures). As a rule, the more power you are making, the smaller the gap you will need. A spark plug's voltage requirement is directly proportionate to the gap size. The larger the gap, the more voltage is needed to bridge the gap. Most experienced tuners know that opening gaps up to present a larger spark to the air/fuel mixture maximizes burn efficiency. It is for this reason that most racers add high power ignition systems. The added power allows them to open the gap yet still provide a strong spark. With this mind, many think the larger the gap the better. In fact, some aftermarket ignition systems boast that their systems can tolerate gaps that are extreme. Be wary of such claims. In most cases, the largest gap you can run may still be smaller than you think. Indexing This is for racers only !! Indexing refers to a process whereby auxiliary washers of varying thickness are placed under the spark plug's shoulder so that when the spark plug is tightened, the gap will point in the desired direction. However, without running an engine on a dyno, it is impossible to gauge which type of indexing works best in your engine. While most engines like the spark plug's gap open to the intake valve, there are still other combinations that make more power with the gap pointed toward the exhaust valve. In any case, engines with indexed spark plugs will typically make only a few more horsepower, typically less than 1% of total engine output. For a 500hp engine, you'd be lucky to get 5hp. While there are exceptions, the bottom line is that without a dyno, gauging success will be difficult. Heat Range selection Let's make this really simple: when you need your engine to run a little cooler, run a colder plug. When you need your engine to run a little hotter, run a hotter spark plug. However, FAIRSALE AUTOS strongly cautions people that going to a hotter spark plug can sometimes mask a serious symptom of another problem that can lead to engine damage. Be very careful with heat ranges. Seek professional guidance if you are unsure. With modified engines (those engines that have increased their compression) more heat is a by-product of the added power that normally comes with increased compression. In short, select one heat range colder for every 75-100 hp you add, or when you significantly raise compression. Also remember to retard the timing a little and to increase fuel enrichment and octane. These tips are critical when adding forced induction (turbos, superchargers or nitrous kits), and failure to address ALL of these areas will virtually guarantee engine damage. An engine that has poor oil control can sometimes mask the symptom temporarily by running a slightly hotter spark plug. While this is a ""Band-Aid"" approach, it is one of the only examples of when and why one would select a hotter spark plug. Using ""racing"" spark plugs Be cautious! In reality, most ""racing"" spark plugs are just colder heat ranges of the street versions of the spark plug. They don't provide any more voltage to the spark plug tip! Their internal construction is no different than most standard spark plugs. There are some exceptions, though. Extremely high compression cars or those running exotic fuels will have different spark plug requirements and hence FAIRSALE AUTOS deals in spark plugs that are well-suited for these requirements. They are classified as ""specialized spark plugs for racing applications"". Some are built with precious metal alloy tips for greater durability and the ability to fire in denser or leaner air/fuel mixtures. However, installing the same spark plugs Kenny Bernstein uses in his 300+ mph Top Fuel car (running Nitromethane at a 2:1 air/fuel ratio and over 20:1 dynamic compression) in your basically stock Honda Civic (running 15:1 a/f ratios with roughly 9.5:1 compression) will do nothing for you! In fact, since Kenny's plugs are fully 4 heat ranges colder, they'd foul out in your Honda in just a few minutes. FAIRSALE AUTOS as a fair and ethical parts supplier tries to stay clear of saying that a racing spark plug (or ANY spark plug) will give you large gains in horsepower. While certain spark plugs are better suited to certain applications (and we're happy to counsel you in the right direction) we try to tell people that are looking to ""screw in"" some cheap horsepower that, in most cases, spark plugs are not the answer. To be blunt, when experienced tuners build race motors, they select their spark plugs for different reasons: to remove heat more efficiently, provide sufficient spark to completely light all the air/fuel mixture, to survive the added stresses placed upon a high performance engine's spark plugs, and to achieve optimum piston-to-plug clearance. Some of these ""specialized racing plugs"" are made with precious metal alloy center/ground electrodes or fine wire tips or retracted-nose insulators. Again, these features do not necessarily mean that the spark plug will allow the engine to make more power, but these features are what allow the spark plug to survive in these tortuous conditions. Most racers know screwing in a new set of spark plugs will not magically ""unlock"" hidden horsepower. Using high power ignition systems Many of the more popular aftermarket ignition systems are of the capacitive discharge type. They store voltage, or accumulate it, until a point at which a trigger signal allows release of this more powerful spark. Companies like Mallory, MSD, Crane and Accel, to name a few, offer such systems. They affect spark plugs in that they allow the gaps to be opened up to take advantage of the increased capacity. The theory is that the larger and the more intense the spark you are able to present to the air/fuel mixture, the more likely you will be to burn more fuel, and hence the more power you will make. We encourage the use of such systems, but only on modified or older non-computer controlled vehicles. In reality, computer controlled vehicles do such a good job of lighting off the air/fuel mixture (as evidenced by the ultra-low emissions), added ignition capacity would do little to burn more fuel since the stock configuration is doing such a good job. Older non-computer controlled vehicles or those that have been modified with higher compression or boosted (nitrous, turbo, supercharged) engines can certainly take advantage of a more powerful ignition system. =========================================================""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""""ahsanonline: Since I am unable to create a new forum thread, I have a question for the experts regarding spark plugs.

FAIRSALE AUTOS as a fair and ethical parts supplier tries to stay clear of saying that a racing spark plug (or ANY spark plug) will give you large gains in horsepower.

To be blunt, when experienced tuners build race motors, they select their spark plugs for different reasons: to remove heat more efficiently, provide sufficient spark to completely light all the air/fuel mixture, to survive the added stresses placed upon a high performance engine's spark plugs, and to achieve optimum piston-to-plug clearance. Some of these ""specialized racing plugs"" are made with precious metal alloy center/ground electrodes or fine wire tips or retracted-nose insulators. Again, these features do not necessarily mean that the spark plug will allow the engine to make more power, but these features are what allow the spark plug to survive in these tortuous conditions. Most racers know screwing in a new set of spark plugs will not magically ""unlock"" hidden horsepower. Using high power ignition systems Many of the more popular aftermarket ignition systems are of the capacitive discharge type. They store voltage, or accumulate it, until a point at which a trigger signal allows release of this more powerful spark. Companies like Mallory, MSD, Crane and Accel, to name a few, offer such systems. They affect spark plugs in that they allow the gaps to be opened up to take advantage of the increased capacity. The theory is that the larger and the more intense the spark you are able to present to the air/fuel mixture, the more likely you will be to burn more fuel, and hence the more power you will make. We encourage the use of such systems, but only on modified or older non-computer controlled vehicles. In reality, computer controlled vehicles do such a good job of lighting off the air/fuel mixture (as evidenced by the ultra-low emissions), added ignition capacity would do little to burn more fuel since the stock configuration is doing such a good job. Older non-computer controlled vehicles or those that have been modified with higher compression or boosted (nitrous, turbo, supercharged) engines can certainly take advantage of a more powerful ignition system. =========================================================""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""Usmanashraf1: Can you please recommend spark plugs for a VTI Prosmatec CNG?

Torque directly affects the spark plugs' ability to transfer heat out of the combustion chamber. A spark plug that is under-torqued will not be fully seated on the cylinder head, hence heat transfer will be slowed. This will tend to elevate combustion chamber temperatures to unsafe levels, and pre-ignition and detonation will usually follow. Serious engine damage is not far behind. An over-torqued spark plug can suffer from severe stress to the Metal Shell which in turn can distort the spark plug's inner gas seals or even cause a hairline fracture to the spark plug's insulator...in either case, heat transfer can again be slowed and the above mentioned conditions can occur. The spark plug holes must always be cleaned prior to installation, otherwise you may be torquing against dirt or debris and the spark plug may actually end up under-torqued, even though your torque wrench says otherwise. Of course, you should only install spark plugs in a cool engine, because metal expands when its hot and installation may prove difficult. Gapping Since the gap size has a direct affect on the spark plug's tip temperature and on the voltage necessary to ionize (light) the air/fuel mixture, careful attention is required. While it is a popular misconception that plugs are pre-gapped from the factory, the fact remains that the gap must be adjusted for the vehicle that the spark plug is intended for. Those with modified engines must remember that a modified engine with higher compression or forced induction will typically require a smaller gap settings (to ensure ignitability in these denser air/fuel mixtures). As a rule, the more power you are making, the smaller the gap you will need. A spark plug's voltage requirement is directly proportionate to the gap size. The larger the gap, the more voltage is needed to bridge the gap. Most experienced tuners know that opening gaps up to present a larger spark to the air/fuel mixture maximizes burn efficiency. It is for this reason that most racers add high power ignition systems. The added power allows them to open the gap yet still provide a strong spark. With this mind, many think the larger the gap the better. In fact, some aftermarket ignition systems boast that their systems can tolerate gaps that are extreme. Be wary of such claims. In most cases, the largest gap you can run may still be smaller than you think. Indexing This is for racers only !! Indexing refers to a process whereby auxiliary washers of varying thickness are placed under the spark plug's shoulder so that when the spark plug is tightened, the gap will point in the desired direction. However, without running an engine on a dyno, it is impossible to gauge which type of indexing works best in your engine. While most engines like the spark plug's gap open to the intake valve, there are still other combinations that make more power with the gap pointed toward the exhaust valve. In any case, engines with indexed spark plugs will typically make only a few more horsepower, typically less than 1% of total engine output. For a 500hp engine, you'd be lucky to get 5hp. While there are exceptions, the bottom line is that without a dyno, gauging success will be difficult. Heat Range selection Let's make this really simple: when you need your engine to run a little cooler, run a colder plug. When you need your engine to run a little hotter, run a hotter spark plug. However, FAIRSALE AUTOS strongly cautions people that going to a hotter spark plug can sometimes mask a serious symptom of another problem that can lead to engine damage. Be very careful with heat ranges. Seek professional guidance if you are unsure. With modified engines (those engines that have increased their compression) more heat is a by-product of the added power that normally comes with increased compression. In short, select one heat range colder for every 75-100 hp you add, or when you significantly raise compression. Also remember to retard the timing a little and to increase fuel enrichment and octane. These tips are critical when adding forced induction (turbos, superchargers or nitrous kits), and failure to address ALL of these areas will virtually guarantee engine damage. An engine that has poor oil control can sometimes mask the symptom temporarily by running a slightly hotter spark plug. While this is a ""Band-Aid"" approach, it is one of the only examples of when and why one would select a hotter spark plug. Using ""racing"" spark plugs Be cautious! In reality, most ""racing"" spark plugs are just colder heat ranges of the street versions of the spark plug. They don't provide any more voltage to the spark plug tip! Their internal construction is no different than most standard spark plugs. There are some exceptions, though. Extremely high compression cars or those running exotic fuels will have different spark plug requirements and hence FAIRSALE AUTOS deals in spark plugs that are well-suited for these requirements. They are classified as ""specialized spark plugs for racing applications"". Some are built with precious metal alloy tips for greater durability and the ability to fire in denser or leaner air/fuel mixtures.

The hard thing to find is the inline fuse which usually is a part of the kit. I think Sound Valley in pindi saddar had some kit's. Pretty sure Hamza will have them too in Lahore. You have to mention what city you live in The alternator upgrade will need to be done. I'm sure even Big3 or Big4 won't help a Mehran's electronics""]""}]}",,

Different products, different characteristics, different sounds isn't really a great way to set up a setup. Regardless, I'd suggest you up your wiring. Is it 0/4 or 8 gauge? Do a big3 and add some inline fuses. Are you power/gnd wires ofc or cca? Even if you upgrade your alternator or add another battery, a mehrans wiring can only take so much beating. For a setup of this caliber, you would need atleast true 4 gauge ofc wiring. Do the big3 with 1/0 gauge and if it's in your budget, run 1/0 gauge or 4 gauge to your amps. Make sure the pwr and gnd wires are the same size. Get the wiring upgrade done, then figure out your next upgrade""]""}]}",,

I have Alto 660CC which has Denso Compressor, the A/C compressor was giving a strange noise while the car idles. As soon as i give accelarator the sound goes. In short the compressor becomes soundless on 1.5K RPM and above. Got it inspected from 3 - 4 wshops and all said to change the compressor as the noise is from inside the compressor. So got the old compressor out and took it as a sample to buy the exact thing. There On the compressor it was mentioned ""Only Use ND-OIL 8"" on the side of the compressor which would not have been visible to read if the compressor had not been taken out , bought the compressor from Bilal gunj and back to the wshop, when came the turn to put oil in it , the A/C guy brought a 1.5 liter water bottle which had oil in it to put it in the compressor..

If your engine has cold start rattle firstly check that you are using the correct oil filter for your engine with a working antidrain back valve, using incorrect filters will cause bleed down and rattle. To correctly diagnose main and big end bearing failure, you are supposed to do an oil pressure test with the correct lubricating oil in the sump and the engine at correct normal operating temperature. If your oil pressure spikes on startup and then falls to below 10 psi pressure at normal temperature, and does not rise correctly when revved the clearances between the bearing journals is causing loss of pressure and eventual wear on the crank Such noise is also caused by ommitting the oil control orifice in the block which regulates flow volume between the block and head (if OHC engine) - What you posted is an acceptable practice only if the top end is certified to be good. I mean checked with tools not dancing around fire, voodoo, andaaza, noise etc etc. I can give you a rattle example of old 84-87 Honda civic 1.2 engines, they require an oil filter with a pressure relief valve which means that unless the oil pressure is high enough the oil filter will not allow filteration, this was done by Honda to ensure oil gets to the crank oiling holes immediately and when the entire oil system is full and the main oil gallery starts to pressurize the filter opens up and allows oil to be filtered. A mitsubishi filter (cheaper compared to Honda) also fits perfectly but lacks this function, this causes the crankshaft to rattle on startup, and your mechanic then tells you that engine ""over all"" required. :). Think wisely - there are factors in Pakistan that do not make sense anywhere else, they are caused by our love of shortcut, bypass, jugaar etc etc.""]""}]}",,

While scientific evidence is lacking, discussions on automobile forums suggest rats may be attracted to high-end cars due to their intricate wiring systems. Preventive measures, such as maintaining cleanliness, parking in rodent-proof garages, and using repellents, are recommended by forum members. Innovative traps like glue books, which effectively trap rats without killing them, are also suggested. Some users resort to unconventional methods like poison-coated balls to eliminate rats, although careful handling is necessary to avoid odors. Overall, while the idea of rats favoring Benz cars may seem unusual, taking preventive measures and using effective traps can help mitigate the risk of rat damage to vehicles.

I would like to call myself an audiophile as I am looking for quality rather than volume. Depth and separation of instruments is what I cherish while listening to music. What I need is information on what to buy and where to buy it in Lahore. I have been going through the forums here and I am open to order stuff online as long as the seller is trustworthy. I am big on an informed purchase and would really appreciate your help. Head Unit Pioneer DEH8850MP The prices for headunits are sky high these days and I plan to scavenge as much use out of this as possible. This head unit is pretty old and has been collecting dust for a lot of years. This was used in my Cultus back in 2014. It has all the SQ stuff which I need, DSP, crossovers, auto time alignment. I think I may be able to use it in an active setup. Through my research I have realised this used to be a pretty good back in 2000s. The only problem I have with it are that it is a single DIN unit and doesn't have bluetooth. But I can make do with using an USC-C DAC dongle. Currently my car has a cheap chinese head unit which costed like 5-6k a year ago. Front stage: I have spent the past week researching about different component speakers and shortlisted a few of them based on availability and budget. But now I have become a bit overwhelmed with information and need to know of any alternates from Hertz, Focal, Massive etc JBL GTO 609C Infinity Reference 6530 Sub stage: For this I just want a decent subwoofer, budget isn't very passionate about this. I am looking for a single subwoofer in a sealed enclosure Amplifier: Currently I have this stuff, note that this stuff is pretty old and has been lying around since late 2000s only to be used in my Cultus back in 2014 for a while before it was sold off: Boschmann PCH-6882EX Specs @ https://store9658340.ecwid.com/Boschmann-PCH-6882EX-p2681999571 JVC AX5700 Specs @ https://support.jvc.com/consumer/product.jsp?modelId=MODL027604&page=3&lang=es Sound treatment: I have treated the front doors and the rear wheel arches and trunk with Orientech 2mm sheets.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""Your initial choice of the 609c and infinity 6530 are more than good enough.

There's no need for another 2 channel amp unless you want to run your 2 way comps active Amp prices have sky rocketed too. However, a good 4 channel that is a tad bit under rated and has enough juice to not let you wanting more from your speakers is the pioneer 4704. Sure the 6704 would be an even better choice but thats 30k+ these days. A 4704 will cost you in the ballpark of 24k The jbl cs1214 is a good entry level sub. I have it in sealed box lined with polyfill and it's doing a great job of keeping with my Helix F62c's. It's tight and accurate and a great sub to start with. Offcourse there are better options but I got that for under 20k and I don't regret it A good set of comps will cost you 25-30k A good 4 channel will cost you 25-40k A nice sql sub will cost between 20-25k Pay more and you can get better equipment.

It is commonly used in various industries such as automotive, construction, and manufacturing. -  - During the welding process, the electric current passes through the wire electrode and generates heat, which melts the metal and forms a weld pool. The weld pool then solidifies, creating a strong joint between the two pieces of metal. -  - MIG welding offers several advantages, including high welding speeds, ease of use, and the ability to weld in different positions. It also produces clean and smooth welds with minimal splatter or slag, reducing the need for extensive post-weld clean-up. -  - Overall, MIG welding is a versatile and efficient welding technique that is widely used in many applications due to its effectiveness and reliability.""]""}]}",,

This step is crucial, especially if the CNG installers have tampered with it to raise idle RPM. Once reset, proceed to adjust the throttle position sensor (TPS) within the range of 0.45-0.55 volts, typical for Japanese cars. This adjustment ensures accurate signal transmission to the ECU, crucial for proper engine performance. However, if the TPS is reading 2.5 volts at idle, indicating a malfunction, immediate replacement is necessary, as it can lead to ECU issues like ""clear flood"" mode during cranking. The ideal voltage range for idle position is around 0.3-0.8 volts, while wide-open throttle (WOT) should read between 3.2-4.5 volts. Failure to address TPS malfunctions can result in adverse effects such as injector misfires and poor fuel economy. Therefore, it's imperative to diagnose and rectify TPS issues promptly to ensure optimal engine function.""]""}]}",,

When I sold my previous Baleno, I had planned to buy a Liana from 06 or 07. Here in Islamabad, it ranges from 700k to 775k in good condition. However, many people advised against buying a Liana due to problems with its coils and expensive parts. But, in my opinion (shared by some Liana owners who are my friends), if you can afford to get all the necessary service and work done by Suzuki professionals, then Liana is a good option. But if you prefer going to local mechanics, then Liana is not a suitable choice. I decided to go for the Baleno again, despite it being more expensive than Liana. This is because local mechanics are able to handle it easily and its parts are relatively less expensive (or at least I believe so). Plus, it fits in my garage, unlike larger cars such as Liana, City > 2004, Civic, Corolla, etc.""]""}]}",,

Regardless, the difference will be quite noticeable over the stock speakers Sound deadening your doors will also increase midbass while eliminating unwanted resonance.

I recently purchased Toyota Alpha 2014 (7 seater) model from a relative. The Odo-meter reads about 180K Km s, we imported the car ourselves, so I'm pretty sure about original mileage. Anyways, once I purchased the car, I changed spark plugs, transmission fluid, engine oil, oil filter, air filter and AC filter. The coolant for radiator is still within decent limit. Also got new Michelin tyres 215/65/16 and drive with 31 front and 30 PSI rear wheel air pressure. ( mentioned in the car door along with wheelbase information) Now with regular fuel I’m getting 14km/L, which is low average given my experience with 3rd Gen and 2nd Gen Prius. I was hitting 20+ with my 3rd Gen 1.8 Prius. I asked mechanic and he said that drive few tanks of High Octane and the average will start to improve. I did that, and on High Octane the average (Highway + city), I am getting is around 16.5Km/L or something. I usually drive in city and over the weekend I go to my hometown Okara from Lahore. What else I should look for to improve mileage ?""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""To address the fuel weeping issue, it's recommended to schedule a diagnostics appointment at Obama Car Care Centre in Tipu Block, Garden Town, by dialing 0321 4106898. The culprit may be a faulty fuel filter in the fuel tank. 2) Prioritize checking the condition of the batteries, especially since you're familiar with Prius operations. This assessment can help determine if the charging or discharging process is functioning correctly. 3) The average fuel efficiency of the Alpha model, as provided by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), is 17 kilometers per liter. Considering its hybrid nature, anything above 13 kilometers per liter is deemed acceptable. However, factors like size and aerodynamics can lead to a 4 kilometers per liter decrease in fuel efficiency. This information is based on personal experience with the model. 4) Regarding tire size, the 215/65R16 may be too big and heavy. Alternatives like the 205/60R16 or 215/55R16 could be more suitable. 5) Acknowledging a previous mistake, the correct tire size is 215/60/R16. Gratitude is expressed to @capsat for assistance, and the issue will be addressed promptly. 6) An update reveals that after cleaning the throttle and applying grease, fuel consumption has improved. Refueling with RON97 and RON92 yielded mileage of 17KM/L and 20KM/L, respectively, indicating a positive impact on efficiency, especially for daily commuting within Lahore.""]""}]}",,

Thanks i have no idea why u didnt find Asad tyres in sadar....its very very simple in direction....coming from GHQ side on murree road, take the FOURTH left turn (the one approx 50 meters after the KFC junction). once u have turned left, asad tyres is about 200 meters ahead onto ur right. now how difficult can that be ??? secondly, the size you are looking for 195/65 is too big for the car. it exceeds 3% allowable tyre difference. either stick with 195/60 or 185/65...no other size. would badly affect ur fuel economy and meter reading""]""}]}",,

For the past several weeks I have heard a faint sound coming from the front right hand side of the car but only when driving over a bad or rough patch of road. I don't THINK its the suspension. I have a feeling something is not right with the steering rack/assembly as the car tends to drift towards the left even though I recently had the alignment redone. Several months ago the front right tyre went into an open manhole at some speed. The impact was enough to slightly bend the rim (stock toyota rim) of the front right tyre. At the time everything else seemed fine with the car so I had the rim replaced (eventually bought new tyres too) and continued driving without any problems. But now I feel that I sometimes hear a sound coming from the same area which took the impact many months ago. Can't describe the sound exactly. Not like something is obviously broken because the sound is not continuous. Sounds almost as if something is loose and needs tightening. The reason I feel it could be the steering rack is because a few times I have felt a slight vibration in the steering wheel.

The purpose of this thread is to share the findings and resolution and help others stuck in such situation. Issue: The brake pedal sank on brake application. It was happening whether the car is stationary or moving. It did sink little when the car was shut off (no booster assist). This was dangerous as the car was not stopping properly, and lunged forward even on full brake application even on lower speeds. The abs kicked in randomly on braking, everytime on hard braking (even on slower speeds with medium braking force while the wheels werent even close to locking). Checked brake oil level, it was full. Cheked for leaks, none found in lines, calipers, master cylinder. Flushed and bled the system to no avail. The most obvious cause in this case is Master cylinder itself (having an internal leak and bypassing fluid via cup seals). Without giving it much thought, replaced it with new Honda genuine part. New parts was bench bled and then bled the system again and lo and behold, the pedal is still sinking. Bled again and again, actuating ABS aswell, wasting couple litres of brake fluid (must have cleaned the lines good lol). Doubted that the new master cylinder is faulty aswell. Tested it by blocking the two outlet ports with cutup line ends with ends shut (desi blockers). The pedal was rock solid. Well, put it all back together and back to sinking. Disassembled all 4 calipers and verified for working, found nothing wrong. The brake pads were nearly new from the last brake job. Searched around on internet and people were having similar issues, a video pointed that it could be the ABS. Will be updating the proceedings in below posts.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""Regular maintenance of brake fluid is essential for vehicles equipped with ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) to ensure optimal braking performance and safety. Annual flushing of brake fluid is recommended to prevent issues such as sinking pedals caused by fluid contamination. Proper bleeding techniques during brake caliper service, including opening the bleeder and using a tube to release trapped air and contaminants, are crucial to maintain system integrity. Mechanics should avoid pushing back caliper pistons without bleeding, as this can lead to debris buildup in proportioning valves or the ABS module. When diagnosing ABS-related issues like sinking pedals, technicians must inspect the ABS hydraulic system ports or isolate the system to identify faults accurately. If ABS module failure is confirmed, prompt replacement is necessary to prevent further complications. Identifying issues such as sticking solenoids within the ABS module, which cause fluid dumping into reservoirs and pedal sinking, requires thorough inspection and replacement of faulty components. Overall, regular maintenance and prompt replacement of faulty ABS units are essential to ensure reliable brake performance and vehicle safety.""]""}]}",,

Everyday I have atleast one bewildered bike rider that gazes at the front of the car in other disbelief. ""Where is the bonnet"" says his face as he nearly crashes into me, only swerving away at the very last second. The I is a difficult car to own, it's thirsty, only gives around 13 km-l. It's a tad noisy due to the fact the engine in underneath the rear seats and worst of all is the maintenance. If you don't have a mechanic that understands these cars, they'll only make your problem worse. Spare parts are rarer than a period of political harmony in Pakistan. It takes as much oil as a Honda City, it takes more coolant than a Honda Civic X. But there's just something about this car that just causes you to get attached to it. It has a personality, it's different and more exciting than most 660cc hatchbacks. So if anyone here has a Mitsubishi I, leave a comment down below. I'd love to know where you get your maintenance done from, do you have a guy that can source space parts. This cars comes equipped with keyless entry and go but the keyless remote has long been lost. Does anyone know where I might be able to get a new one made, obviously I don't have the original so I can't make a clone.

I have been a german car fan mostly, however, on a whim, I acquired this Vauxhall Astra Twintop as a project to restore during the winter months, where afternoons, evenings are dark and depressing and you can not do much outside. A bit of background on the car: The Car on the whole: The car is a 2008 model in the Design trim. It is a twintop body type, which is Vauxhall's jargon for a hard-top convertible coupe. The car is attractive to look at, and, being a hard top convertible, it is very practical and usable in the British weather all year round. The car is compact in size, owing to the cleverly designed 3 pc folding roof, you really don't need a big boot to accommodate the folded roof when you have the top down. The weight of the roof in the boot along with the strut braces add weight to the rear end while adding rigidity to the chassis, once the roof is down. Being the not so basic model, I found that there's decent amount of kit added as standard on the car. I will discuss features and options in more detail further along in the post. The Engine & Transmission: The car has a 1.8L 4 Cylinder 16v petrol engine that produces 138 Bhp and 175 nm of torque. Official 0-60mph time is 10.7 seconds. The engine is rather punchy and can keep up with motorway traffic (70 mph) while it returns decent fuel economy (14 km/l local and 17.5 km/l on the motorway with AC). The transmission is a 5 speed manual transmission with a reverse gear on the opposite side ( Like most GM cars I suppose, Daewoo racer in Pakistan had that kind of a shifter layout) Interior: The interior is well kitted out with comfortable half leather seats with height adjustment and lumbar support, MP3 / Aux enabled audio with a monochrome display. Push start with Key-less entry. The cabin is a mix of leather and piano black plastic with silver accents. Steering wheel controls for audio and the on-board computer. There's decent legroom given the size of the car both on the front and rear. a 6ft tall adult can comfortably be accommodated in the rear seat with the front seats less than half way forward. There are powered mirrors for both front and rears and the wing mirrors are powered and heated. It has automatic lights and wipers on the front. However I do miss the rear wiper which is not there as the rear screen obviously needs to fold with the roof. The car does not have Cruise Control, however it is a very easy retrofit and a quick upgrade, in the case of my car, just a matter of replacing the indicator stalk and enabling Cruise control on the ECU. The wind breaker was an optional extra offered by Vauxhall and is not included on this car. Hence, wind makes it slightly difficult to drive at high speeds with the roof down. Exterior The exterior is finished in Star Silver metalic with matching bumpers, door handles and wing mirrors. 17 inch alloy wheels with relatively low profile tyres mean that the car sits on the road very nicely and handles very well. Fog lamps are standard on the front and rear of the car. There's chrome trim on the front grill and the boot lid that compliments the car very nicely and a 3rd brake lamp (LED) is mounted on the boot lid as well. A chrome exhaust tip is a nice looking addition to the rear of the car.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""The To-Fix List so far: New Battery - Installed Coolant level sensor to be replaced as it raises a false alarm. Full Service (Oil, Filters, Plugs). Wing mirror cover replacement on the Driver's side. Upgrade low beam bulbs to brighter ones. Horn does not work. This is a common fault on these where the control interface module goes funny. However, in my case, I think the module is okay and it is either the fuse or the horn itself that has packed up. Minor Scratches and scuffs on the body will be sorted ( It is an old car after all) Upgrades that i have planed for: I am looking to restore / improve the car keeping it OEM+. Here is what i have planned so far OEM Cruise Control retrofit OEM Satnav retrofit 18"" Alloy wheel upgrade with OEM Vauxhall Twintop wheels. Upgraded High Strength rear braces - Already installed as the previous owner was able to bend the rear brace on one side. Roof folding mechanism upgrades- replacing plastic cogs with copper ones. If i am able to find a complete interior / dash panels, I may upgrade the interior with heated full leather seats.""]""}]}",,

I'm here to assist you!""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""i want all Pak Wheelers to inform dem about serious draw backs by direct connection of radiator fan in ur ride Direct Connection of the Radiator Fan In PAKISTAN most of the cars have this problem that their radiator fan starts directly when the car is started regardless of the water temperature in the radiator, because the fan (electrically driven) circuit is by passed from the thermostat switch. Well our mechanics do this because they think that by keeping the water temperature (indicated at the control panel by temperature gauge) to the minimum possible level will help engine perform well. Actually the normal operating temperature of the engine, referred with respect to the water temperature in the radiator is 82 ± 3 °C. It is important to note that the water in the radiator boils at 115 to 120 °C .The radiator cap keeps the water under pressure and that is why the water boils above the its normal boiling point. The calibration of the gauge starts from 50°C .So the total range on the dial of the gauge is from 50°C to 120°C. So when needle reaches the middle of the gauge, engine is actually at its NORMAL WORKING TEMPERATURE {average temp of the gauge (as averages fall in the middle) is (115+50)/2=82.5 °C}. So at the normal working temperature the needle should be somewhere in the middle of the gauge. Whereas our so-called skilled mechanics interpret this as over-heating of the engine.THIS IS TOTALLY WRONG! In a moment I will be listing the disadvantages of having your radiator fan direct .But first I would like to tell the readers about the cooling system of the engine in brief . In water circuit of the engine (water circuit means the path of the water in engine) the effort is made to keep the water away from radiator till the water temperature in the water jacket reaches the 82°C mark. Simply you can say that water is not allowed to go in the radiator and is made to circulate inside the water jacket. This is done by using a device called THERMOSTAT VALVE. This thermostat valve when closed does not allow the water to circulate in the radiator. As soon as the temperature starts to go beyond 78°C the valve opens. This allows the water to be circulated in the radiator. If the heat dissipation of the radiator cannot keep the temperature at about 82°C the THERMOSTAT SWITCH completes the circuit of the electrically driven radiator fan to keep the temperature at 82°C by circulating air. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that if temperature goes beyond 82°C it is comparatively acceptable as the most likely disadvantage is the increased potential of the engine to knock at higher gear and low engine rpm . But if the temperature is less than the normal operating temperature then it will cause not only the deterioration of the engine performance but also shortening your engine life. So in most of the cars the thermostat valve is removed, making the water circuit complete all the times and also bypassing the thermostat switch to keep fan running with engine regardless of engine temperature . The problems that can arise as a result are discussed below: Problems associated with Carburetion Mixture Preparation The petrol air/mixture preparation in the carburetor is a temperature dependent function. To keep the mixture preparation efficiency maximum the water in the radiator and water jacket is fed to the outer walls (around venturi) of the carburetor to keep it warm. This increase of the temperature helps to mix up the petrol/air. If the temperature of the water is not at optimum, the petrol air mixture preparation in the carburetor will be effected .This will cause the engine to run on non-homogeneous mixture causing engine to misfire and vibrant engine operation is resulted. One must have noticed the vibrant engine operation on cold starting in the morning. This is also due to the same reason as engine temperature is very low and mixture preparation is not good. So by keeping the fan direct you are going make the engine run with vibrations and it will not deliver its full power as the mixture (petrol/air) is not homogeneous (well prepared) . Mixture Distribution If the temperature of the radiator water is kept low then the carburetor temperature also keeps low as the water circulates around the carburetor venturi (the cylindrical passage down the carburetor where air/petrol gets mixed) .The optimum carburetor operation is achieved at higher temperature. So by keeping the fan direct temperature is kept around 55 to 60 °C. This not only effects the mixture preparation but also the mixture movement as well. The mixture is prepared in carburetor and burnt in the cylinder. To get to cylinder the petrol/air passes through carburetor venturi and inlet manifold. If the temperature of venturi and manifold is low then the condensation of the petrol takes place. This will also cause the engine to run on non-homogeneous mixture and the engine running results will be the same as discussed in the above case . It is important to note that if the mixture fed to the cylinder is not homogeneous then the combustion will not produced the desired amount of power .By meaning the homogeneous mixture it is assumed that the mixture strength expressed by weight ratios is same through out the mixture volume .The combustion is so fast that in non homogeneous mixture the petrol will not burn in the areas where not enough air is not present .This results in loss of fuel and engine produces less power .So by keeping your fan direct you will actually be doing the same thing as discussed above as water temperature will be low. Problems associated with Engine Four Stroke Cycle As the engine temperature is not measured directly but is measured with respect to water temperature in the radiator so when the temperature of the radiator water reaches somewhere around 115 to 120°C, the temp. of the engine is enough to cause serious engine damage and it can even result in ceasing the engine . The point here which I would like to emphasize is that engine temperature is never measured directly but the water temperature is measured. So if water temperature is low so is the engine temperature.The discussion to follow will be carried taking the radiator water temperature as reference. When engine is started the temperature at the piston top or piston temperature is very low, same as atmospheric temperature. During engine operation it reaches hundred of degrees centigrade. No metal or alloy is developed yet which has zero expansion rate. So to accommodate the expansion the piston is made oval shaped. At cold starting the piston does not completely seal the cylinder, but as temperature rises the piston expands and seals the gap. At water temperatures above 115 to 120 °C the expansion is so great that the piston gets stuck resulting in serious engine damage. Below temperatures of say 75°C the piston is loosely fit in the cylinder. We will discuss engine condition keeping in mind that water temperature as it is less than 75°C as fan is made to operate directly preventing the engine to operate at its normal working temperature. Intake stroke When the normal operating temperature of the engine is not achieved then the piston is not complete fit in the cylinder. During intake stroke piston descends from TDC(top dead center) and reaches BDC (bottom dead center). So if the piston is not completely fit than the petrol/air will not be sucked in properly. This will result in low engine volumetric efficiency Compression Stroke During compression stroke piston reaches from BDCto TDC. If the temperature of the piston is below normal then it will not fit the cylinder. So the petrol air sucked in prior ot compression, when compressed during compression stroke will bypass the piston and piston rings into the crankcase (It will be discussed in detail later on). So full compression is not achieved and this results in lower engine output and higher fuel consumption . Power Stroke During power stoke the rapidly expanding gases pushes the piston down giving power. If the piston does not fit completely then the expanding gases will by pass the piston rings thus resulting in incomplete power transfer making the engine H.P to decrease and fuel consumption to increase . Exhaust Stroke During exhaust stroke if piston is not complete fit then the exhaust will not be good. The exhaust air will by pass the piston, rings and will reach the crankcase causing oil fouling (it will also be discussed in detail later on) . Engine Oil Fouling (a) If the engine is made to run on low temp than optimum then the compression stroke is not fully efficient. The petrol/air mixture instead of being compressed, by passes the piston and piston rings. On its way to crankcase it passes the cylinder wall. The cylinder walls are soaked with engine oil to lubricate piton and rings. So when petrol by passes the piston rings it mixes with the oil on the cylinder walls. Petrol being excellent organic solvent dissolves and dilutes the engine oil, promoting engine wear . (b) During power and exhaust stroke the burnt gases which are normally non metallic oxides (acidic in nature) bypass the piston rings and enter the crankcase. Here these gases mix with the water vapors. This forms acidic compounds that get mixed with engine oil resulting in altering the oil PH. It makes the engine oil acidic and corrosion always takes speeds up in the acidic medium. For this reason the engine oils are made buffers (which can retain there PH although some amount of acid is added to them). But they can retain there PH only if a small amount of acid is added. So if engine is run consistently on low temperature then it will promote engine wear as engine oil will get acidic . (c) The unburnt particles from the combustion chamber also by pass the piston as they are very small in size. When they enter the crankcase they get mixed with the oil. The engine oil are made detergents. That is they can accumulate small amount of these particles and hold them in suspension or you can say dissolve them. But this tendency is limited to a small amount. If prolonged use of engine at low temperature is carried out then it will cause pre mature engine wear. As these particles do not completely dissolve in oil, they narrow down the small channels in engine lubrication circuit. This effects the engine lubrication as proper amount of oil is not fed to the moving parts resulting in engine wear. Summarizing The Above Discussion The following are the problems summarized keeping in mind that if engine is not running on its normal working temperature. (1) It will decrease the air/petrol mixing efficiency . (2) It will effect the distribution of petrol/air mixture to each cylinder. (3) This will decrease the volumetric efficiency of the engine resulting in increased fuel consumption . (4) The engine oil will get fouled prematurely resulting in more oil changes . (5) The fouled engine oil will result in the premature engine wear shortening the engine life. (6) Vibrant and rough idle (low speed running). (7) Engine will never give its full power and torque . (8) It will increase the fuel consumption without increasing the output of the engine . Rear wheel Drive Cars In rare wheel drive cars the radiator fan is not electrically driven but it is belt driven. It starts running as soon as the engine is started. To keep the engine temperature at optimum level the water is not allowed to circulate (when cold) in the radiator as the THERMOSTAT VALVE remains closed. As soon as the temperature starts to rise the valve is opened and the belt driven fan keeps the air circulating making the water temperature stick to an optimum level. So in rear wheel drive cars the Thermostat valve should NEVER BE REMOVED. As it will result in the same problems as discussed above (by removing thermostat valve and making fan direct in front wheel cars) .

The temperature at which fans operate automatically may differ between vehicles, but it's commonly around 92 degrees Celsius. Regarding thermostats, they typically begin opening at temperatures around 82 degrees Celsius in many cars. Additionally, it's worth noting the potential risks associated with direct fans, as they can keep the car excessively cold and may not be conducive to high RPM driving.""]""}]}",,

Additionally, ensure that the silencer is cleaned to avoid encountering smoke puffs, as seen in recent rebuilds. Keep the thread updated with progress and share pictures of the completed swap inside and out. A dirty engine bay post-swap reflects poorly on both the mechanic and owner; if the mechanic skips cleaning, it's essential to take responsibility and clean it yourself.

Having restored a 63 Bug as a test case i was really confident that we can restore any bug in Pakistan provided we have correct panels available and a right body work ustad. Having worked with Mr Safdar from Pir wadhai i was really confident that if i provide him correct panels he can do any grafting work.

Front Hood hinges were changed along with lifting mechanism (Springs were installed in 1958), Front apron was changed from 4 fins to 3 fins, Rear Apron was changed from H pattern to no pattern, Dashboard was changed, These above mentioned changes are just the visual changes not to mention the mechanic changes (which were of no concern to me as i want my bug to just visually look like an Oval).

On the other hand, you'll often see OEM hoses using a spring action clamp, like so: Now, I don't buy it. A spring clamp seems to distribute clamping force evenly across the circumference of the hose, reacting to expansion and contraction of the material with temperature changes. A worm gear clamp, by design, would bite harder on one point on the hose and would not evenly distribute clamping force. This effect would only grow worse as a hose expands and contracts. I would assume that after completing several thermal cycles, the clamp would begin to cause a leak or even bite into the hose and breach it.

Now let's come to the topic of concern for me. I am a bit confused related to Toyota 2C engine oil recommendation that I discovered on the PakWheels forum pages. Most people recommend Caltex Delo Gold Ultra; ZIC 5000; and some people suggest putting any good diesel engine oil with API CI-4 rating. While checking the 2C's repair manual, I got to know that the recommended API rating for 2C engine is CF (CE and CD can also be used). Next, I checked various well-known engine oils that are famous especially for petrol engines, for example, Mobil 1 5W-50 Peak Life and OW-40 New Life, Shell Helix Ultra 5W-40, ZIC XQ 5W-40 and so on and so forth, they all have API rating of SN/CF or SM/CF. The ""oil guide utility"" or ""oil selector utility"" that is available on many oil manufacturers' websites (Mobil, Eurol, etc.) and they primarily used for choosing right engine oil for any particular car. The user provides the make, model, year and engine type to the utility and the utility, in response, recommends a particular oil based on the car manufacturer's recommendation. In European countries, 2C engine came in Toyota Carina E and perhaps in Toyota Avensis during 1990s. The oil guide utilities from different oil vendors recommend ONLY API CF oil for 2C engines. In these countries, 2C engines easily last for about 500,000 KMs and more without any major overhaul. And if you visit any automobile store, they don't recommend any CI-4 oil for 2C engines. So, here comes my question. Has any owner of Corolla 2.0D tried putting such engine oils with API SN/CF rating that are popular for petrol engines like Shell Helix Ultra 5W-40 fully synthetic, Mobil 1 5W-50, ZIC XQ or any other fully synthetic oil with API SN/CF rating? Why Pakistani 2.0D needs overhaul most of the time. One reason I know is our ""Ustaads"". Any other valid reasons for overhaul(s)? Why we put CI-4 oil?? Is this backward compatible? If yes, why so many problems with our 2.0Ds? Here, I am mentioning links of some oil selector guides from some manufacturers.

It certainly helped that the first thing I did when I got the car is replace the murky black fluids that hadn't been changed in 30 years with Toyota GL-4 and GL-5. After the shaft seals and a couple of bearings were inspected and replaced with new ones, the boxes were put back together and I was asked to put in the shop's ""khulla"" oil of unknown spec. Since there was absolutely no way I was going to do that, Warco or Delo Gear EP-5 was the alternative. While the Delo GL-5 would've been fine for my diffs, it wouldn't work for the transfer case and transmission, which both needed GL-4. ""Sir ham toh dekhte bhi nahi hain, GL-4, 5, sab aik hi cheez hay. Ham dalte rahe hain, sab chalta hay, befikar rahain.""

The owner at Imran Gearbox Repair insisted I fill 2 liters into the gearbox, and had their worker dump it into the shifter hole instead of using the fill bolt to verify the quantity.

Straining synchros, hard downshift to 2nd and 1st, and sluggish response made me suspect the box was overfilled.

Next day, the guy wouldn't respond to my calls or messages, including the pictures I sent him of the shifter shaft bolt dripping and leaking all over my driveway. I had a trusted shop open up the fill bolt, which immediately spouted oil all over the mechanic's arm and face. I thrust a beaker underneath to measure what came out. Remember: the spec calls for 1200ml, the gearbox had 2000ml in it. This is how much came out of the fill bolt.

Following is the list i will discuss in detail just keep refering to this diagram when reading ahead; -- Accelerator Linkage (it has an idle adjustment screw not visible here ).. right most item in diagram -- The air-cleaner side ... marked as 10 -- Hot water pipes ... 40 -- TPS (throttle position sensor) ... 20 -- IACV (Idle air controller valve) other names include ISC (idle servo controller) and Auto-choke .. 70 -- A housing with its seal or gasket .. 57 is the gasket  Parts wise explanation and adjustment  ..

A distance of about 7 inches indicates the oil's travel from the bleed nipple. However, using clear pipes and preventing backflow is crucial for precise measurements. Regarding clutch lifespan, it heavily depends on usage; improper practices like holding the car on an incline with the clutch rather than brakes can rapidly wear out the friction disc. This issue is commonly heard among Honda owners, indicating concerns about clutch durability, especially compared to Toyota models. Some prefer Nissan's cable-type clutch for its perceived reliability.

During the compression stroke, combustion gases bypass the piston rings and enter the crankcase, diluting the oil and promoting corrosion and sludge. Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) helps to cycle clean air through the crankcase, evacuating these combustion gases. At idle and low RPMs, vacuum in the intake manifold draws a spring-loaded PCV valve open, creating negative pressure in the crankcase. Clean, filtered air from the airbox is drawn into the crankcase through a breather hose, sweeping through and carrying blow-by gas and oil mist out through the PCV valve, where it's fed into the intake ports to be burned.

I haven’t posted at Pakwheels for a long time so I’m here with another project. The car in question is a 2002 HA12 Alto. It’s a PKDM variant which originally came with an F10A engine. The engine was a little over 300,000km driven but it was still running strong. I was getting around 14km/l within city (I know it’s unbelievable for this engine but a combination of keeping it well-maintained, different jets in the carburetor and light foot driving helped achieve this.) The idea behind this swap was to improve the fuel average of the vehicle with the insane fuel prices these days and to convert the transmission to auto. If I could get better performance, that would also be a plus. Now I could go the safe route of a K6 auto swap to get better fuel average but that wouldn’t have cut it because of the lack of power. I could use a K6 turbo instead but that wouldn’t help me achieve the fuel average figure that I was after. Therefore, with limited options to achieve what I wanted, I decided to swap in a Honda L-13A IDSi with a CVT transmission into it. Why an L-13A I hear you ask? a) It is known to have good fuel average, even in heavier cars such as the Honda City, Civic and the Honda Jazz/Fit, b) It would have a CVT Transmission, therefore helping achieve the auto transmission bit and c) with 85hp and about 120nm torque, it would offer good power to weight ratio in a car that weighs a little shy of 700kg. I have an ongoing series of Videos for this project on my channel, you may visit the channel at, www.youtube.com/@funcariauto/19 Here are some specifications of the engine. Engine Code: L13A Engine Capacity: 1339cc (Offered in the 1.4 Honda Jazz GG/Fit GE, 1.4 Honda Civic FD) No. of Cylinders: 4 IDSi – Intelligent Dual Sequential Ignition, which means there are Two Plugs per cylinder, sequentially fired for better efficiency. Power: 85hp @5700RPM / 120nm Torque @2800RPM Compression Ratio: 10.8:1 7 Speed CVT-Transmission (SWRA) Most of the work on it is done in-house, which includes mechanical, fabrication, electrical and aesthetic.

For the longest time, I've been on a goose chase trying to figure out why my engine would stall, after it had warmed up, when pressing the clutch in. It would either stall and die or idle rough at 900rpm, lighting up the oil pressure light. The first time this happened, I had just changed to Valvoline SynPower 5W-30 API SP. ""Synthatec gaarha nahi hota, gari purani hay, 20W-50 dalen."" I'd rather not kill my turbo, but the oil pressure light was an obvious urgent fix. I switched to Delo Gold Ultra, changed spark plugs, but the issue persisted. I even tested my oil pressure, installed an oil pressure gauge, and am going to back to using 5W-30 or 0W-40 full synthetic oil at the next interval. So it likely wasn't a low oil pressure issue. Eventually, the tiny hoses feeding coolant to the IAC valve in the manifold developed leaks. I bypassed them, and the car idled at 2000-2200rpm, but at least I had oil pressure. Got sick of the ridiculous fuel consumption, got new IAC valve coolant hoses installed back in. New Problem: engine would surge with clutch in and at idle, but only if I gently raised throttle to about 1200rpm. At that point, it would start surging. 2500rpm, 1000rpm, repeat. Obviously, this made driving in stop-and-go traffic very difficult. It happened all the time.The only way to make it stop was to turn on the AC, and even that only slightly calmed it. Turning AC off, or when the compressor disengaged due to the evap coil thermostat, would make the surging come back. Nobody knew what the hell was going on. Until, messing around with vacuum lines, we bypassed this idle control solenoid: Once again, the idle shot up. No surging. Pinch one line off, engine stalls. Aha. The old one seemed to not be working. I found an Afghani replacement, and it solved the problem. Now, I'm trying to figure out what it does and how it's controlled. I notice it doing two things: Adjust idle, bringing it down when high and up when low. I'm confident that it's temperature-dependent. BUT IT ONLY does this (I checked) when: Vehicle completely stopped. Transmission in neutral Clutch not pressed in Dropping idle back down after AC switch is turned off. Once the compressor clutch disengages, engine RPMs rise until ""something"" happens and they drop back down to 1000rpm. That ""something"" doesn't happen if this solenoid is disconnected, and surging starts again once engine rises to 1200rpm. So... what is the control scheme for this thing? How does the ECU determine what to tell it? Is it a normally open solenoid like I suspect? Why does it compensate idle only when those three requirements are met??? I'm puzzled. Is this common across other cars from this era? It's an inconvenience if the car fully warms up in traffic, because unless I come to a dead stop, put it in neutral and give it a second, the car won't set the idle at 1000rpm and ""remember"" it. It'll either do something like 1200rpm or 800rpm, or stall out, unless I do this little dance at a dead stop. The solenoid gets very hot under normal operation, and the Afghan replacement seems to be failing again, behaving inconsistently like the previous one. I want to buy a brand new part, but it's roughly $200. Does anyone have any experience cleaning out and rebuilding these? P.S. Installed an 88°C thermostat, using Glysantin G48 coolant, removed locked-solid clutched fan, installed electric fan with a shroud and temp switch rated for 88°C. Engine still doesn't warm up all the way (water temp needle slightly below halfway) unless it's a hot sunny day with AC on. When warm, it's more likely to stall unless I do the 3-step dance.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""It seems like you are dealing with multiple issues, including a cat temperature warning light, idle hunting, and questions about the VSVs. The cat temperature warning light is related to a thermal fuse in the catalytic converter housing, which is challenging to find as it's no longer manufactured. Regarding idle hunting, you should check the cold start idle up thermostatic unit and the throttle body bore. The VSVs can be either normally open or normally closed, depending on their purpose. In the case of your AC-related VSV, adjusting it can help maintain a stable idle when the AC clutch disengages. Finally, the signal generator in your setup informs the ECU about engine speed and the approaching TDC of a cylinder. It's crucial to address these issues systematically, considering specific components and their functions to ensure proper diagnosis and resolution.""]""}]}",,

If you buff headlights, it's advisable to apply a clear coat designed for plastic surfaces to maintain protection.

Firstly, when dealing with cable-type gear shifting mechanisms, it's essential to check for lever jamming or cable adjustments, and using WD40 to lubricate the components can often resolve these issues effectively. As for engine oil selection, sticking with ZIC A for summer use is recommended, particularly the A+ variant, which is designed to perform well in different weather conditions. Regarding the functioning of modern manual transmissions, they rely on synchronizers to facilitate smooth gear changes, eliminating the need for double-clutching. While some additives claim to reduce friction and protect components, it's crucial to monitor their effects closely, as using the wrong oil viscosity, such as SAE 140, can lead to damage to synchronizers over time.""]""}]}",,

I have an JDM Nissan AD 2006 regd 2012, 1300 cc having QG13DE engine with A/T. The car has completed 215,000 kms on the ODO and till last month it was running on original engine (without any rebuild). For the last 3 / 4 months, I observed that car losses its power gradually by the time and vibration in engine at idle or low rpm. The car moves to & fro (jerks) when stopped on signals/traffic while in D position. The jerking is quite high and I have to bring the gear lever to N while the car is stop. The car has no cold/hot starting issues and always start in one self. no overheating history, thermostat valve is in place and fans are auto. In Pakistan, the car is mostly driven on CNG (almost 100k kms). IMO Overall engine is in good condition having no engine oil loss, blue smoke, carbon deposits at silencer end, smooth engine sound etc. Last month, due to missing, vibration and lack of power, my mechanic advised me to rebuild its engine head with new valves, valve seats and machining etc. I followed his advice and rebuild engine head with new taiwan valves set and related stuff, the machining was done at Al-Madinah Engineering at water pump. After dis-assembling, we have found one exhaust valve seat burnt and that particular cylinder was misfiring. After rebuild, i observed that the engine missing/vibration has gone and power is restored to an extent (but not completely) I notify the matter to mechanic but as they all said, it will be better with time (and it doesn't). Now the condition is, the car performs well for 6k kms after the rebuild and during the last week I started observing slight vibrations in engine, car also vibrates/jerks minutely when stop in D position. The missing can be heard at exhaust tip also. The mechanic is so dumb he cannot feel the vibration and missing and advice me to either increase engine RPM through software or ignore it, its all normal. (well IMO its not). I think valve seat(s) is/are damaged again and we have a loss of compression in cylinders. My car mostly driven on National Highway within speed of 80km/h to 120km/h. I use Havoline Formula 10W30 for this engine with guard oil filter. Kindly advice guys, i am so fed up with these mechanics. Should I have to rebuild head again, or make adjustments in valve shims by grinding them a little. I am also thinking of replacing complete kabli head from shershah, they are asking 22k for it. Kindly also advice, do we have some special valves and valve seats for use in CNG vehicles, as i heard form many that CNG produces high temperature in combustion chamber hence burn valve seats.

By now you have seen the damages to the car, front bumper, front lights, backlights, rooftop light are missing, stickers, sides broken (near bumpers), windscreen and one window glass is missing or broken. I kicked off the proceedings with front bumper. For this I used milk can and a wall clock plastic base. Used Soldering iron and knife for plastic welding and cutting, heating for giving desired shapes. After this I used sanding and coloring with shinny black spray. Next I picked was front lights, initially I used bike indicators. It was unsuccessful in the end, due to heating process glass became faded and due to low quality plastic, buffing didn't work. Then I used bike helmet visor, it didn't get faded. I am aiming in future phase, to use JDMs broken lights, better quality plastic, buffing would be possible. Beside glass work I also added background chrome, using aluminum foil. For backlights I used bike reflectors, shaped them as per area by heating. For rooftop light, I used a light part from a donor car. For body damages I used filler, sourced from dent/paint shop. Used plastic, mold them as per need, glued them to the broken areas to fill that area. Applied filler for final finish. LEDs were used for illumination, unfortunately I didn't work quiet well in the end. I didn't have much time so I decided to improve it in the next phase. For now I captured the effects in dark. Pictures to follow, For windscreen and window, I also used helmet visor, crafted them, molded them, colored them. For side emblems I took help from plotter (service available at any number plates shop). Result can be seen later in this write-up in final outcome pictures. After completing all the repair work, I proceeded with color process. Used matt black for the lower base, shinny black for glass, side mirrors, bumpers, tyres. Shinny red for the body color and hardener in the end. Now the final outcome: That's all I hope you will like my effort. Thank you for your time.

Dashboard warning symbols indicating a transmission issue, possibly due to overheating caused by factors like high-speed acceleration, towing, low oil levels, or coolant overheating, necessitate thorough examination. Every automatic transmission features a heat exchanger, either integrated into the radiator or as a separate cooler, but consistent overheating may warrant transmission replacement as internal parts are rarely sold separately. Despite the reliability of newer transmissions, problems can still occur, requiring oil changes and correct fluid levels. Newer cars may experience transmission issues, even under warranty, necessitating replacement. While heat alone isn't typically enough to cause failure, seeking advice from a qualified mechanic like syncview can ensure thorough troubleshooting beyond just error codes. Unlike other manufacturers, Honda typically includes only basic information like chassis number, engine number, and build date on their plates.""]""}]}",,

The Honda Accord 3G itself, this is my new toy that I'll be playing with & since people are not really into reading threads here now, I'll be posting updates on my YouTube channel as well, to which you all can subscribe & stay updated to the project there, as well as here. Avoid the lousy picture quality, these were shot at 6am on my iPhone. This car is a treat for me for the price that I've got it for, I'll be following the rule of one project at a time especially after my RX8 because projects are a pain in the ass & a drill to your pockets, but I'll be starting this car from scratch as well so it will definitely require time but it'll be worth the wait, I promise!

Sunroof AND IT WORKS TOO Links to my previous projects Bringing my RX back to life - Mazda RX8 1JZ VVTi Mazda Asalam o alaikum everyone. Months ago, I got my hands on a Mazda RX8 2005. The car was swapped with a 2JZGTE by the previous owner but I bought the car without any engine under the hood. It was parked in a plot for months and the owner wasn't willing to sell it but after 2 months of procrastination, I finally got my hands on it. The car was and still is in a pretty bad condition, the last owner had the car showered in matte blue, then matte pink and currently the car is showered in matte yellow …  The Budget Modification - Honda Civic EK Honda Asalam o alaikum Pakwheelers, back in 2013 I bought a Honda Civic EK 2000 for a project but since I had no idea about how expensive and time consuming a project car could get, I could never save up the proper amount to modify it as per my needs. I was a broke college student back then so all I could modify in it were the headlights, license plates and I got it converted to 5 studs from 4 because I wanted to get a specific set of rims on it and sadly, they weren't available in 4 studs ever. My RX…  abdulmunimqadri: Remember her?

The absence of sunroof drain spouts and potential clogging can result in water ingress, causing various problems like bad smells, carpet damage, and rusting of floors and side panels, with accessing the sunroof drain tube potentially requiring dashboard removal. Ensuring thorough rust removal and applying cavity wax is crucial, especially around the lower pinch weld area, to prevent water intrusion. Consider sourcing replacement tail lamps carefully, as USDM lamps may offer a different aesthetic compared to the original double-glazed ones. Additionally, investing in cavity wax and learning its application, such as a homemade mixture of turpentine or odorless spirits, beeswax or paraffin wax, and oil, could protect against future rust. Accessing trapped cavities for wax application typically involves removing rubber bungs from various parts of the car, while other users may have alternative recipes for cavity wax.""]""}]}",,

Please advice guys.""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""[""If you intrested in diy then use this instruction. other wise use this information for cast your project enjoy;) Things You'll Need: Step 1 Sketch your design. Without getting your layout on paper first, your body kit is almost guaranteed to look terrible. This is the place to let your artistic side run wild. Get an idea of what you want by looking at existing body kits, and put your favorite aspects of each one into your design. li value=0"" Step 2 After removing the existing bumpers and trim on your car, cut lengths of high-density foam into the approximate sizes of each part. Using blocks of scrap foam, raise each part until it is resting where it will eventually be located. For the time being, you can secure it in place using some duct tape, if you wish. /li li value=0"" Step 3 Following your drawings precisely, use a heavy marker to draw out the details directly onto the foam. Make note of the depth each indentation or cutout should be carved to. Draw half of each body panel first, then carefully measure and copy each design detail to the opposite side to ensure perfect symmetry. All it takes is one mistake to completely ruin the project, so triple check your measurements before work begins. /li li value=0"" Step 4 Begin carving your design into the foam, being careful not to damage the parts during this process. When you lay the fiberglass on top of the foam, remember that each of the parts will be slightly thicker, so compensate for that during your cutting. Make sure every single cut lines up with the marks you drew in the previous step. If you make a mistake, you don't have to scrap the entire piece, just cut out the ruined section, glue another block of foam in its place, and resume work. /li li value=0"" Step 5 Remove the finished foam pieces, and cover them tightly in aluminum foil to prevent the resin from sticking. You may want to use an adhesive spray to hold the aluminum into place on the foam. Next, spray the outside of the foil with a non-stick cooking spray, which will act as a mold release when you remove the fiberglass. The parts are now fully prepped. /li li value=0"" Step 6 Begin laying your fiberglass. Start off with just one sheet soaked in resin, and lay it across the outside of the mold. Use a roller to push out any air bubbles, and tuck the fiberglass sheet around the edges and contours of your body kit. Allow the single sheet of fiberglass to completely dry, then gently pull it off of the foam mold. Be careful, as the single fiberglass sheet will be very fragile. /li li value=0"" Step 7 Reinforce the inside of the parts using multiple layers of thick fiberglass matting. Smooth out the air bubbles on each layer, and allow adequate dry time before moving on to the next layer of glass. By placing this matting on the inside of the parts, you can add as much thickness as desired without changing the outside shape of the finished product. /li li value=0"" Step 8 Sand the outside of the parts using a rough grit sandpaper, to smooth out any bumpy areas or lumps. A metal file can be used around the openings to ensure clean edges. Use a proper breathing respirator, thick gloves, and long sleeves to protect yourself. Once the finished look is achieved, blast the parts with an air comperassor to remove sanding dust, then wipe the entire surface down to remove the last bits. Now is a great time to do a test fit to make sure the parts line up to your satisfaction. /li li value=0"" Step 9 Cover the entire outside surface with Bondo to create a smooth, finished texture much like a worked piece of auto body sheet metal. Multiple layers may be necessary to thoroughly cover the surface. After letting it cure, sand the Bondo to a flat surface, but don't leave it perfectly smooth. You want to finish with a somewhat rough sandpaper to make sure the paint sticks. Wipe the finished product with isopropyl alcohol to prep it for the next step. /li li value=0"" Step 10 Prime the parts for paint. Any commercial automotive primer in a spray can will work fine. Use long, sweeping motions to cover the entire surface. Start spraying the can before it hits the surface, and do not stop spraying until you have completed the sweep, and have cleared the surface on the other side. This ensures uninterrupted coverage. Two coats of primer is plenty, and it only needs to dry 5 to 10 minutes between coats. Let the final coat cure for a couple of hours before moving on to paint. /li li value=0"" Step 11 Paint your body kit. Use the same, long sweeping motions to completely cover the surface. Use multiple coats of very light paint, as opposed to thicker coats. Same with the primer, let it cure for 5 to 10 minutes between coats, then move on to the next one. It may take 10 or more coats to thoroughly cover the surface. When done, top it off with 2 coats of clear coat to protect the finish. /li li value=0"" Step 12 Mount the body kit to your car. You can use the same mounting system that the original bumpers and trim pieces used, though depending on your car, you may have to craft some custom brackets to do so. Double-check clearances to make sure the panels are tight and everything looks like a good fit. /li""]""}]}",,

Jumbolon is a local product used for heatproofing roofs and may not provide the desired level of sound insulation. Peel and Seal, while effective for sealing broken roofs, may not be suitable for vertical installations due to heat resistance issues. Lambo sheets, though a good cheap alternative, may not offer the same level of performance as higher-quality materials. Some recommend Dynamat equivalent brands like STP Sound Deadener or Roadkill for the outer frame of the door, while Lambo sheets can be applied to the inner side. Self-adhesive soundproofing sheets, typically 6mm thick, are also an option worth considering for sound absorption. However, for diesel SUVs, options like Peel&Seal, Lambo sheets, or Namda may be more suitable and cost-effective.

Proper installation by experienced fitters and regular maintenance are crucial for optimal performance and engine health.

Typically, RPM sensors have two wires, often colored blue, which need to be correctly wired according to the gauge manufacturer's instructions. Once the wiring is verified and any potential electronic control issues are addressed, monitoring the sensor's performance, particularly when the temperature gauge reaches specific positions, can help diagnose and resolve the problem effectively""]""}]}",,

Some view Ceramic Coating as akin to a lacquer coat, albeit less durable, lasting only a year or two if properly maintained. PPF, being a thermoplastic urethane film, offers more permanent protection against abrasions and minor damage. However, if PPF is damaged in a specific area, the entire panel may need replacement.

Sharing my knowledge on it ..ur comments and suggestions will be highly appreciated Basic Tuning . Throttle body service : A common step these days, technically its not to be done unless there is a serious issue but since every one is doing it so i do it as well .. just spray some carburetor cleaner in throttle body . Plugs : check gap .. new plugs come with 1.0 or 1.1 gap .. older can be set upto 1.3 gap .. for cng vehicles set gap to 0.8 .. clean plugs .. plugs used more than 40k (iridium) may be replaced and normal plugs after 25k km. always use OEM recommended genuine plugs .. those cheap rs 160/- plugs have irregular currents and can cause damage to coils etc . Air filter : Genuine filter only .. exception for cng vehicles as there filter is changed more frequently . Oil : OEM recommended .. Thinner oil like 0w20 or 5w20 may be replaced with 5w30 for hotter climate areas .. do not shift from fully synthetic to semi and back .. use a type for once .. its better to use fully synth for first 75k km or 100k km then shift to semi synth like 10w40 .. but if compression is good keep using fully synthetic .. thicker oil chokes internals and causes all kinds of problems .. so stick to OEM PCV : choked PCV builds up excessive pressure in crank case, causing smoke in exhaust and may also cause reduced performance of car Max Speed Not being Attained . CAT ; if clogged will restrict exhaust gases and maximum speed .. Clean CAT but never remove or damage its mesh .. U will end in disturbed air fuel ratios, high fuel consumption, poor idle and loud engine sound .. replace CAT if required . Fuel pressure ; Use of substandard fuel causes strainer to choke or pump to decrease efficiency causing poor pick up and /or high speed .. the best way to check is to attach a pressure guage near the fuel injector rail .. if the presure is 40psi or more then things r ok . Injectors : same problems as above .. individual injectors can be checked by removing wire clip while car is in idle .. clogged injectors r cleaned on ultrasonic machine and treatment with injector cleaniners also helps but frequent use can damage rubber parts .. though injector cleaners r not very efficient Poor Acceleration . EGR : this was one culprit which caused my car acceleration problem .. clean it and make sure to clean its passages as well . VVT timing : cam shaft in vvti engines has cam phaser (timing advance / retard mechanism) which gets stuck when thicker oil is used and sludge is formed .. solution may be in flushing engine and giving a slight movement to cam phaser .. in severe cases cam phaser has to opened and cleaned . OCV : oil control valve operated cam phaser so this has to be clean alongwith its filter . Coils : weak coils can also cause acceleration issue .. always use quality plugs or ur coils will die early . CVT : cvt oil and cvt performance can also cause accleration issue .. oil can be physically checked but cvt can only be checked on a obd scan tool Poor Economy . General tuning : do a general tuning, as explained above . Fuel Trims : buy a mini diagnostic tool (ELM -327, approx price rs 1000/-) works on most cars, runs on android application ""torque"" .. check fuel trims .. meaning fuel adjustment before and after engine .. a lean or rich mixture indicates the problem area .. like O2 sensor issue, MAF sensor problem .. temperature readings tell how CAT is working . Sensors : ur air fuel ratio is disturbed so clean MAF(or MAP) and O2 sensors first. In further investigation, u may check functionality of sensors and wiring / signals from ECU . CAT .

Firstly, regular washing with a mild car shampoo using soft tools like a sponge or microfiber cloth helps remove dust and pollutants without scratching the paint. Applying a protective wax or sealant provides an extra layer of defense against UV rays and heat, extending the paint's lifespan. Parking in shaded areas and using a breathable car cover further minimizes exposure to direct sunlight, preventing paint fading or cracking. Avoiding abrasive materials during cleaning and maintaining regular waxing and polishing routines also contribute to preserving the paint's appearance. While these measures can help, it's important to note that they may not entirely prevent issues like Florida paint cancer or swirl marks caused by improper washing techniques. Additionally, understanding different paint protection products like wax, sealants, ceramic coatings, paint protection film (PPF), and vinyl wrap can guide you in choosing the right option based on your car's needs and budget. Sealants, for instance, are suitable for daily-driven cars, offering good durability without the expense of ceramic coatings, while products like Menzerna Power Lock and Sonax PNS are recommended for their proven effectiveness.

While newer car models may offer improved technology, manual control is valued, particularly in situations like getting stuck in mud, where gear shifting aids in control. Personal experience, such as handling a Corolla with brake failure by shifting gears, reinforces the reliability of manual transmission, especially in remote areas with limited access to workshops and mechanics. Additionally, anecdotes like a lancer's automatic gear failure within six months of use in a village context underscore concerns about automatic transmission durability. However, opinions may vary, with some viewing automatic cars as a luxury, appreciating models like the 2002 Oriel PT. Nonetheless, considerations of fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and performance characteristics between automatic and manual transmissions highlight the multifaceted nature of the debate. For instance, automatic transmissions tend to be thirstier on fuel, require costly servicing, and may deteriorate if maintenance is overlooked, with fewer pre-owned autos observed to be in good condition. Technical differences, such as torque converter operation relying on oil pressure and its implications for power transmission and towing capacity, further delineate the differences between automatic and manual transmissions. Finally, in instances of car battery failure, manual transmission cars may be push-started, while automatics necessitate alternative solutions like jump-starting or seeking assistance from another vehicle.""]""}]}",,

The discussion shifts to debunking misconceptions about premium oils in certain car brands, emphasizing that major automakers often use well-known oil brands like Mobil, Shell, BP (Castrol), and others for their factory fill. The amusing anecdotes highlight the tendency of some individuals to associate specific brands with higher quality, creating a humorous perspective on such beliefs. The mention of selling Bahlsen branded biscuits at a premium in Pakistan due to perceived quality reflects the influence of branding on consumer perceptions. Additionally, the narrative touches upon the amusing reactions of people witnessing bulk oil drums at dealerships and their misconceptions about oil quality. The discussion concludes with the importance of following OEM guidelines for oil change intervals rather than relying on marketing claims by oil manufacturers.""]""}]}",,

Here we go:  Common misconception:  ""projectors are useless without hid , with normal bulbs u will face many problems in vision""  Actuality:  That is far from true, projectors have far better output even with halogen bulbs, take the camry for example it comes with halogen projectors and light output is WAY better compared to a reflector housing. Projectors come in two different types. 1.Halogen 2. HID .... Now aftermarket projectors that are sold ... 99.9% of them are Halogen projectors ... but as everyone does not know this , they put HID's in the Halogen Projectors and the output is ridiculous to say the least.The reason is because the focal point of the halogen bulb is different from the HID bulb. Misconception:  ""Why Install Projectors in The First Place??.. Why Not Only Install HID's In Stock HeadLamps??.. They Give More Light Than Projectors.."" Actuality:  That is also false, HID in reflector housings gives the worst output.The glare you get is blinding to say the least.Most of the folks put HID in halogen projectors and then complain that the output is worse. Here is the output of light in descending order: HID Projector>Halogen Projector>Reflector Housing. Now let me show you comparison pictures of outputs in different applications. Real HID Projector Output: No light above the cutoff line  Another image of a real HID projector( This is a RHD projector, hence the higher side is on the left)  Halogen Projector(with halogen bulb) Output:No light above the cutoff line   Halogen Projector(with HID bulb) Output ... This is a common mistake Notice the Light has dispersed. Light has escaped above the cutoff line.Oncoming traffic gets a little glare in their eyes.  HID in reflector Housing: By far the worst output .Has the worst output. The is no evidence of a cutoff line.That's why the oncoming traffic gets glare in their eyes.   More Pointers:  1. If your car came with Halogens from the factory, Halogens will give you the best visibility(in your stock headlight) no matter what anyone says.  2.The purpose of the high beam is to put light in the distance.When your high beam reflector is not meant for an HID then how in the world is the HID going to be effective. Also HID's take time to come up to full intensity(usually 5-15 seconds) and that defeats the purpose of a high beam.   3.Light output(measured in lumens) is inversely proportional to the color temperature(measured in kelvins or K) so the most light you would get will be out of 4300K(Same color temperature as daylight). Beyond 6000K its just plain useless.  One thing to note the reason that the ""Blue"" HID lights seem to be brighter is because of the simple reason that the human eye is very sensitive to blue light which is the very reason it dazzles our eyes and gives the illusion that it is brighter which in fact is totally false. After-market Projectors All of the projectors headlamps available at car accessory shops are Halogen, most of the people do not know this, and when they buy them and put an HID Kit in the projectors, they start complaining of the lack of visibility.  A simple way of identifying a halogen projector is that it simple uses any of the halogen bulb types for example like H11,H3 etc.  Real HID Projectors use HID bulbs like D2S,D1S etc.   Cars with HID reflector housings(from the factory): Now before you go all flaming on me that there are some cars out their like the 2nd Gen Toyota Prius,9th Gen Toyota Corolla(in some markets),8th Gen Civic Mugen RR etc that have HID's from the factory even though they have a reflector housing; Let me explain that as well The cars above all have one thing in common, their reflector housings were designed from the ground up to be used with an HID bulb.These reflectors are diamond cut for more precise cutoff to reduce most of the glare and use a bulb known as D2R (R for Reflector).Half the bulb glass is covered with paint to reduce the the glare even further.

I'm here to assist you!""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Hello guys, as you might have guessed from my old signature I'm all against HID kits and all that.Whenever I see a thread with ""HID"" in the title,I immediately jump to it to share my views.Most people have some wrong ideas about HID and projector lights.I am going to copy and paste some of the information I shared in the old forums but did not get noticed. Here we go:  Common misconception:  ""projectors are useless without hid , with normal bulbs u will face many problems in vision""  Actuality:  That is far from true, projectors have far better output even with halogen bulbs, take the camry for example it comes with halogen projectors and light output is WAY better compared to a reflector housing. Projectors come in two different types. 1.Halogen 2. HID .... Now aftermarket projectors that are sold ... 99.9% of them are Halogen projectors ... but as everyone does not know this , they put HID's in the Halogen Projectors and the output is ridiculous to say the least.The reason is because the focal point of the halogen bulb is different from the HID bulb. Misconception:  ""Why Install Projectors in The First Place??.. Why Not Only Install HID's In Stock HeadLamps??.. They Give More Light Than Projectors.."" Actuality:  That is also false, HID in reflector housings gives the worst output.The glare you get is blinding to say the least.Most of the folks put HID in halogen projectors and then complain that the output is worse. Here is the output of light in descending order: HID Projector>Halogen Projector>Reflector Housing. Now let me show you comparison pictures of outputs in different applications. Real HID Projector Output: No light above the cutoff line  Another image of a real HID projector( This is a RHD projector, hence the higher side is on the left)  Halogen Projector(with halogen bulb) Output:No light above the cutoff line   Halogen Projector(with HID bulb) Output ... This is a common mistake Notice the Light has dispersed. Light has escaped above the cutoff line.Oncoming traffic gets a little glare in their eyes.  HID in reflector Housing: By far the worst output .Has the worst output. The is no evidence of a cutoff line.That's why the oncoming traffic gets glare in their eyes.   More Pointers:  1. If your car came with Halogens from the factory, Halogens will give you the best visibility(in your stock headlight) no matter what anyone says.  2.The purpose of the high beam is to put light in the distance.When your high beam reflector is not meant for an HID then how in the world is the HID going to be effective. Also HID's take time to come up to full intensity(usually 5-15 seconds) and that defeats the purpose of a high beam.   3.Light output(measured in lumens) is inversely proportional to the color temperature(measured in kelvins or K) so the most light you would get will be out of 4300K(Same color temperature as daylight). Beyond 6000K its just plain useless.  One thing to note the reason that the ""Blue"" HID lights seem to be brighter is because of the simple reason that the human eye is very sensitive to blue light which is the very reason it dazzles our eyes and gives the illusion that it is brighter which in fact is totally false. After-market Projectors All of the projectors headlamps available at car accessory shops are Halogen, most of the people do not know this, and when they buy them and put an HID Kit in the projectors, they start complaining of the lack of visibility.  A simple way of identifying a halogen projector is that it simple uses any of the halogen bulb types for example like H11,H3 etc.  Real HID Projectors use HID bulbs like D2S,D1S etc.   Cars with HID reflector housings(from the factory): Now before you go all flaming on me that there are some cars out their like the 2nd Gen Toyota Prius,9th Gen Toyota Corolla(in some markets),8th Gen Civic Mugen RR etc that have HID's from the factory even though they have a reflector housing; Let me explain that as well The cars above all have one thing in common, their reflector housings were designed from the ground up to be used with an HID bulb.These reflectors are diamond cut for more precise cutoff to reduce most of the glare and use a bulb known as D2R (R for Reflector).Half the bulb glass is covered with paint to reduce the the glare even further.  Now you all be the judge.I have made the mistake of putting HID's in reflector housings but after doing extensive research I have come to the conclusion that HID should only be used in HID Projectors Only.

Using the above mention information i know that a Hid projector with a HID can give the desired amount of perfection but how much will it cost ? Not less then $300 and can range till $500. so what can a guy do if he is a budget buyer ? well what i did was buy a HId and shove it in the high beam and when you get tired throw it out and put the halogen back. All i have experienced this and i must say if you have the money to put on it then you can only achieve the results other wise just put an hid satisfy your self for a couple of months and every thing will be fine. second option is that put some good quality halogens they will cost you almost Rs5000 to your door step if you import(i dont think you will find them in the local market.)""]""}]}",,

My Honda CRZ(k24 swapped) neededa clutch change and the workshop did the job but when they put back the speed snesor ( CSS, Countershaft speed sensor, its in front of transmission and comes with 8th gen onwards Honda, Honda city 2011 onward and 9th gen civic etc etc.) So long story short when the car was put in gear, the snesor touched the gear teaath and ecu got fried and because Hondata Flashpro was locked to it, and no scanner can connect to this ecu, that also got wasted. So i began searching for the solution but online there was no such info of what size washer to put between sensor and transmission. I even looked at Honda manual diagrams and they even dont put any washer there. So after a lot of triala nd testing i have found the solution once and for all. Its so delicate balance between too far or too near. IF even half a millimeter far the speedo and VTEC wont work. HAlf a mm close and you risk fry ecu or sensor. Honda Speed Sensor Washer Mystery Solved. and today morning just recieved a call from friend that They could not start the car aftter chaging the clutch, i immediately guessed what happened and i was right. So if you have a manual Honda with a CSS sensor, which needs a clutch work than buy these cheap wahsers i mentioned in video. that are 10 washers in just RS 450 and can save a lot of money. i wasted 2 lakhs plus.

Mechanics should exercise care when removing sensors to prevent misplacement of spacer washers, which are essential for maintaining correct air gaps and sensor functionality. Different manufacturers employ varying sensor configurations, with Honda utilizing a 5V VCC rail for sensor sourcing and feedback. However, mishaps such as wire shorts can disrupt this system, highlighting the need for careful handling. Reinstalling sensors with their original spacers intact is standard practice, as seen in transmissions like Nissan/Jatco CVTs, which require specific shims for maintaining proper air gaps. It's advisable to engage qualified mechanics equipped with modern tools to avoid such issues. Additionally, when dealing with international shipments and customs clearance, proper documentation is essential to verify the origin and status of items, particularly for goods not manufactured in Pakistan. Collaborating with reputable freight companies knowledgeable about the required documentation processes is crucial for smooth transactions and compliance with copyright and import regulations. Industrial equipment control modules often undergo similar shipping procedures for refurbishment, underscoring the importance of engaging experienced freight services for handling such transactions.""]""}]}",,
